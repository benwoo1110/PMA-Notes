### IDA Pro

#### Overall main function
![](20220929150150.png)

1. Initialise AES cipher with key as `ijklmnopqrstuvwx`
2. Startup web socket connection to `www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com` at port `8910`
3. Use the web socket to execute remote access function

#### Setting up encryption
![](20220929153039.png)

 - Key length: 16, 24 or 32
 - Block size: 16, 24 or 32
 - Output size:
   - key 16:
     - block 16: 10
     - block 24: 12
     - block 32: 14
 - key 24:
     - block 16/24: 12
     - block 32: 14
 - key 24:
     - block 16/24/32: 14
 - Set entire Block to NULL at offset 8
 - Set entire Output to NULL at offset 488

#### Starting backdoor
![](20220929153146.png)

 - 2 pipes are created from reading and writing between socket and command line
 - hReadPipe, hReadHandle, hWritePipe, hWriteHandle

![](20220929155807.png)

 - Series of duplicating handles, but essentially still the same 4 pipe handlers

![](20220929160008.png)

 - Creates a new command line process

![](20220929160039.png)

 - Creates a thread to receive data from socket and run in command line

![](20220929160100.png)

 - Creates a thread to get output from command line and send to socket

 - Overall diagram of how the attacker communicate with victim's command line

### Notes
 - Rigndael cipher is used
 - Attacker creates a backdoor with shell access

## Questions
1. Compare the output of strings with the information available via
dynamic analysis. Based on this comparison, which elements might
be encoded?


2. Use static analysis to look for potential encoding by searching for the
string xor. What type of encoding do you find?


3. Use static tools like FindCrypt2, KANAL, and the IDA Entropy Plugin to
identify any other encoding mechanisms. How do these findings compare with the XOR findings?


4. Which two encoding techniques are used in this malware?


5. For each encoding technique, what is the key?


6. For the cryptographic encryption algorithm, is the key sufficient? What
else must be known?


7. What does this malware do?


8. Create code to decrypt some of the content produced during dynamic
analysis. What is this content?
