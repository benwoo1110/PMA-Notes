## Findings

### Strings
![](../Images/Lab-15-01-01.png)

 - Presents of some output messages

### Functions

 - Executable only imports MSVCRT functions, no windows API calls

### IDA Pro

#### Disassembly errors
![](../Images/Lab-15-01-03.png)

 - There are some disassembly errors:
   - Jump instruction with a constant condition
   - Multilevel inward-jumping sequence

![](../Images/Lab-15-01-04.png)

 - Convert the irrelevant code into data, shows only the instructions that are relevant to understanding the program
 - Change `0x00401062` to data, `0x00401063` now chnages to `push offset aSonIAmDisappoi`
 - Do that to all similar disassembly errors

#### Check argument counts
![](../Images/Lab-15-01-05.png)

 - `[edp+8]` represents the argc, number of argument 
 - Ensure that there is 1 argument value

#### Check for string sequences
![](../Images/Lab-15-01-06.png)

 - eax[0] -> p
 - eax[2] -> q
 - eax[1] -> d
 - The command line argument string must start with `pdq`

#### Set breakpoints

![](../Images/Lab-15-01-08.png)

 - Set breakpoints at checks for argument, string sequence and printf output

#### Executing with correct payload
![](../Images/Lab-15-01-09.png)

 - Set parameter to `pdq`

![](../Images/Lab-15-01-10.png)  

 - The output is `Good Job!`, means the checks were successful

## Questions
